            <h2>Basic Rules of Squash</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>The Serve:</strong> Each point begins with a serve. The server has two chances to hit the front wall above the service line and below the out line. The ball must land in the opposite back quarter of the court.</li>
                <li><strong>Scoring:</strong> Matches are usually best of 5 games, with each game played to 11 points. The player must win by two clear points.</li>
                <li><strong>Rallies:</strong> After the serve, players take turns hitting the ball against the front wall above the tin and below the out line. The ball can hit the side or back walls at any time, as long as it hits the front wall before touching the floor.</li>
                <li><strong>Interference and Lets:</strong> If a player cannot make a shot because their opponent is in the way, they can call a let and replay the point.</li>
            </ul>
